			NASA partnered with Kirby, a company that makes vacuum cleaners. NASA had computer programs that showed how air traveled through fans. Kirby designed new fan blades with the help of NASA’s computer programs. The vacuum cleaner blades were stronger and could go 18,000 spins per minute. The vacuum cleaner was quieter. <br>
